This blog has been a long time coming. I think I've owned this domain for the better part of a decade now. But finally in the year 2023, I think it's time that the internet gets yet another blog.

For the better part of the last decade, I've been working in Technical Support Engineering roles and at home I spend a good chunk of my time moonlighting as some psuedo DevOps Engineer, standing up Self-Hosted applications and services within my home network. My goal with this blog is to document the goals and challenges of Self-Hosting and having a Home Lab. With the occasional fun posts on just things I'm interested in general such as 3d printing, art, design, tech gear, and much more.

So I hope you'll hit that bookmark and check me out in the next one.
