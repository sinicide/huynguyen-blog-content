My name is Huy Nguyen, I'm a troubleshooting puzzle solving Technical Support Engineer. In my free time I like to upcycle older hardware and build out my ever evoling home lab, iterating and automating until I've reached a point of perfection, but un/fortunately I'm nowhere near done.

This blog serves as a chronicle of the evolution of my home lab and self-hosting over the course of time. As an avid seeker of knowledge, I find immense joy in imparting the wisdom I acquire along the way. So, if your curiosity piques at the mention of home labs, self-hosting, distributed computing, and the allure of all things nerdy, I invite you to join me on this extraordinary journey of discovery.
